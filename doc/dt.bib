%NOTES: 
%     - give unique names to each citation (usually the last name of the first author and the two digit year)
%     - for the title only you have to use {} brackets to capitalize words - except the first word
%     - in the author list, 'and' is a keyword, so don't use commas... always use 'and'
%     - before you add a paper, search this file thoroughly to make sure it's not already in here
%     - fill in all fields, otherwise this is useless!!
